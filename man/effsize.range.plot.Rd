\title{Plotting Effect Size (Cliff's Delta) with Confidence Interval}
\description{
Plotting Effect Size (Cliff's Delta) with Confidence Interval, and calculate Cliff's Delta effect size.
}
\usage{
effsize.range.plot(dist1, dist2, threshold = c(0.147, 0.330, 0.474), transparency = 150, col = viridis(4))
}
\arguments{
  \item{dist1}{the first distribution for comparison}
  \item{dist2}{the second distribution for comparison}
  \item{threshold}{A list of 3 doubles that represents the threshold for negligible, small, medium, and large effect size.}
  \item{transparency}{an integer range between 0-255 that represents the transparency of the colors}
  \item{col}{a vector with four colors for the four effect size segments (negligible, small, medium, large). By default using the \code{\link[viridisLite]{viridis}} color palettes which is colorblind-friendly.}
}
\value{
  A list of class \code{effsize}. See \code{\link[effsize]{cliff.delta}} for details.
}
\examples{
temp.dist1 = rnorm(100,1,2)
temp.dist2 = rnorm(100,-1,2)
effsize.range.plot(temp.dist1, temp.dist2)
