# Distribution Comparison

Distribution Comparison (`DistCompare`) is a toolset for visualizing comparison between two distributions.

This toolset contains functions that plot:

1) two distributions side by side for comparison (`comp.dist.plot`), and

2) Cliff's Delta effect size and the confidence interval (`effsize.range.plot`).

For a complete list of functions, use `help(package = "distcompare")`
