# Distribution Comparison

Distribution Comparison (`DistComp`) is a toolset for visualizing comparison between two distributions.

This toolset contains functions that plot:

1) two distributions side by side for comparison (`plot.comp.dist`), and

2) Cliff's Delta effect size and the confidence interval (`plot.effsize.range`).

For a complete list of functions, use `help(package = "distcomp")`
