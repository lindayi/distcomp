# Distribution Comparison

Distribution Comparison (`DistCompare`) is a toolset for visualizing comparison between two distributions.

This toolset contains functions that plot:

1) two distributions side by side for comparison, with automatically logged axis when necessary, and returns Wilcoxon tests results (`comp.dist.plot`);

2) Cliff's Delta effect size and the confidence interval (`effsize.range.plot`).

For a complete list of functions, use `help(package = "distcompare")`

## Install

**Install DistCompare from Github**
```
install.packages("devtools")  # if you haven't installed devtools

library(devtools)

install_github("lindayi/distcomp")
```

## Sample

## Next Step

- Support for Cohen's d and Hedges' g for effect size

- Support for customizing thresholds for effect size
